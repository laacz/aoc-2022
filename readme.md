# Advent of Code 2022

These are solutions for the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) challenges.

This year it's Go time. Or to put it punly, let's give it a Go. Or just let's Go.

```bash
# Runs the tests first. If they pass, runs solutions for the given day.
run.sh day01
```

## Day 1

Easy peasy.

## Day 2

Lemon squeezy.

## Day 3

Nothing to see here.

## Day 4 

Same here.

## Day 5

Straightforward, until I got to the second part. In certain cases Go modifies target slice, instead of copying. So I had to resort to moving crates one-by one.

## Day 6 

Shortest solution to date. Guessed the second part's task, so both parts use the same implementation.

## Day 7

Easy, but had to think about the right approach longer than I'd like.
